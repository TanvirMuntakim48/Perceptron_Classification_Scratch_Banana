# Implementing Perceptron Algorithm from Scratch

In this notebook, I implement Logistic Regression using Perceptron unit from scratch and I further add a few extra things like:
* Mini-Batch Training
* L2 Regularization

The logistic regression model is trained on the Banana dataset obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/l3llff/banana

This code is almost the same as the Logistic Regression Implementation on Banana Quality Dataset, only difference is the use of Perceptron activation instead of the Sigmoid activation
